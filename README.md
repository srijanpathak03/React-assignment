# React DataTable Assignment

## Overview

This project is a React application developed using Vite and TypeScript, which integrates with PrimeReact's DataTable component. The application fetches data from an API, displays it in a paginated table, and allows users to select rows with persistence across page changes.

## Features

- **Server-side Pagination**: Fetches data from the API on every page change to ensure that only the required page data is loaded.
- **Row Selection**: Users can select rows individually or all at once, with the ability to perform bulk actions.
- **Custom Selection Panel**: A custom panel allows users to select multiple rows at once or manage their selections efficiently.
- **Persistent Row Selection**: Maintains row selection and deselection across different pages, ensuring that user choices persist even when navigating between pages.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that offers a fast development experience with improved performance.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to help catch errors early and enhance development.
- **PrimeReact**: A UI library for React providing a variety of components, including the DataTable component used in this application.
